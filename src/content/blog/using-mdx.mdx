This theme comes with a basic setup for MDX, including support for code blocks and customizable components.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a powerful tool for writing content that includes interactive elements. It allows you to write Markdown content and import React components directly into your markdown files.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a component inside of MDX:

import HeaderLink from '../../components/HeaderLink.astro';

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
	Embedded component in MDX
</HeaderLink>
